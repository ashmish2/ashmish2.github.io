title: What can we learn from big oil companies?
---
Recently, Anonymous attacked [Oil companies](http://www.valuewalk.com/2012/07/exxon-shell-bp-gazprom-and-rosneft-emails-hacked-by-anonymous/).
They also posted details on pastebin. Most of the passwords are in hashed form (as expected). But some passwords are in clear text as well and the reason is very evident if you look at the passwords used.
Some of them are:

pass123$

Administrator

defaultpass

letmein 

shellsupport

These are by no means strong passwords, as I mentioned in my post. Although, hackers were able to login and get all the passwords but they cannot use hashed password. Hence no harm as per user level. But not using strong password can cause irrevocable damage. Hackers may login into your account and leak confidential data. Although, this didn’t happened in this case as the motive behind the attack was different but it doesn’t mean it cannot happen with you.
